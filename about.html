			<h1>About Allied Body &amp; Frame</h1>

<p>Peter Brisbo became the owner of Allied Body & Frame in 1982, after working as manager for the business. The shop has thrived over the past 25 years, with the same core team providing the highest quality results to customers.  Subscribers to <a href="http://checkbook.org">checkbook.org</a> may view our rating of being one of the top auto body shops in the Bay Area.</p>

<h2>Personnel</h2>

<p>Along with the multiple years of management experience, all of the Allied Body & Frame technicians are kept current with training from I/CAR Collision Repair Training and ASE (National Institute of Automotive Service Excellence). The technicians also undergo training to ensure proper use of on-site equipment and products.</p>

<h2>Staying Current</h2>
  
<p>On January 2009, a California mandate will take effect replacing solvent-borne auto body repair paints with water-borne paints.  Allied Body & Frame takes pride in being the first shop in Berkeley to comply with this mandate.</p>

<p>Allied has completely integrated the PPG Envirobase paint system into its operations. PPG Envirobase was chosen by Allied because of its historic industry reputation of excellent cutting-edge research, offering unparalleled color match with lower VOC emissions.</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>
